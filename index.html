                                always wash your hands with soap and water for 20 seconds for general food safety.

                                touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be

                            <p>Stay aware of the latest information on the COVID-19 outbreak, available on the WHO
                                website and through your national
                                and local public health authority. Many countries around the world have seen cases of
                                COVID-19 and several have seen
                                outbreaks. Authorities in China and some other countries have succeeded in slowing or
                                stopping their outbreaks. However,
                                the situation is unpredictable so check regularly for the latest news.</p>
                            <br><br>
                            <p>You can reduce your chances of being infected or spreading COVID-19 by taking some simple
                                precautions:</p>
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
                                    them with soap and water. <p>Why? Washing your hands with soap and water or using
                                        alcohol-based hand rub kills viruses that may be on your hands.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Maintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself and anyone who is
                                    coughing or sneezing. <p>Why? When someone coughs or sneezes they spray small liquid
                                        droplets from their nose or mouth which may contain virus.
                                        If you are too close, you can breathe in the droplets, including the COVID-19
                                        virus if the person coughing has the
                                        disease</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth. <p>Why? Hands touch many surfaces and can pick
                                        up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes,
                                        nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and can make you sick.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Make sure you, and the people around you, follow good respiratory hygiene. This
                                    means covering your mouth and nose with
                                    your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
                                    immediately. <p>Why? Droplets spread virus. By following good respiratory hygiene
                                        you protect the people around you from viruses such as
                                        cold, flu and COVID-19.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>Stay home if you feel unwell. If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing,
                                    seek medical attention and call in
                                    advance. Follow the directions of your local health authority. <p>Why? National and
                                        local authorities will have the most up to date information on the situation in
                                        your area. Calling in
                                        advance will allow your health care provider to quickly direct you to the right
                                        health facility. This will also protect
                                        you and help prevent spread of viruses and other infections.</p>

                                <li>Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where
                                    COVID-19 is spreading widely). If possible,
                                    avoid traveling to places – especially if you are an older person or have diabetes,
                                    heart or lung disease. <p>Why? You have a higher chance of catching COVID-19 in one

                                    the patient has laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. This will help the healthcare

                            <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients
                                may have aches and pains, nasal
                                congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and
                                begin gradually. Some people become
                                infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%)
                                recover from the disease without
                                needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes
                                seriously ill and develops
                                difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high
